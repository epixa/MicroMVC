This MicroMVC implementation is for rapid application development.  The goal of 
this framework is to provide a traditional MVC implementation with both speed 
and best practices in mind.

Epixa MicroMVC is not a replacement for full-fledged, feature-rich MVC 
frameworks such as Zend Framework or Symfony; rather, this is simply an 
alternative to be used when performance is a high priority and the great 
flexibility of one of these powerhouses is not necessary.

This requires at least PHP 5.3.3, but 5.3.5 or higher is recommended.
